= Security upgrades

== Goal

This inventory hook allows gathering information about available security upgrades
on the system.

IMPORTANT: For now it is compatible with Debian and Ubuntu, and requires 
/etc/os-release to identify the system.

The hook checks the state of package list updates
to ensure a valid answer.

== Property

This hook produced a property named `security_upgrades` which contains:

* `-2` is the system is not supported by this script
* `-1` in case of impossibility to get the security upgrqdes list
* the number of available security upgrades (>=0)
