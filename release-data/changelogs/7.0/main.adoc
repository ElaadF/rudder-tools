=== Release notes

Special thanks go out to the following individuals who invested time, patience, testing, patches or bug reports to make this version of Rudder better:

* Marek Haluska
* Gaëtan POBLON

This is a bug fix release in the 7.0 series and therefore all installations of 7.0.x should be upgraded when possible. When we release a new version of Rudder it has been thoroughly tested, and we consider the release enterprise-ready for deployment.
